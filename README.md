# Basic-Flex-Box

This repository results a simple box model layout in any modern browser. A box model in css is a box that consists of four different parts (i.e. content, padding, border and margin) and is wrapped around every HTML elements.
In simple words, a box model is used when designing or layouting a web content. This task shows my understanding of HTML and CSS.

To complete this task, I used CSS flex box layout. It is because it is easier to design flexible responsive layout without having to use float or positioning. 
One of the other reasons that I chose to use this layout is that it supports most of the modern broweser.

To replicate the given layout, I used two flexbox containers. One contains a header and the other contains two flexbox items (i.e. content and the sidebar).
I used simple CSS for styling all the flex box items. I added different pictures in the layout and also a search bar on the header to make it more lively and exciting.
